# Preparation

> **Note**: In CRIB analysis, processors introduced in this Chapter may be customized.
> they are discussed in [the CRIB Chapter](../CRIB/chapter.md).
> Currently, `artemis` itself was modified and rebuilt, but there is a possibility of developing equivalent processors within the `art::crib` namespace in the future.
> If that occurs, this manual will need to be updated (okawak expected someone to do so).
